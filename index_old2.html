    <h3>Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h3>

    <h4>TO LEON WERTH</h4>

    <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>

    <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>

    <p>In the book it said: <i>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</i></p>

    <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>

    <p>But they answered: <i>"<b>Frighten?</b> Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i></p>

        <li>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. </li>
        <li>I have flown a little over all parts of the world;</li>
        <li>it is true that geography has been very useful to me</li>
        <li> At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.</li>
        <li>If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</li>
